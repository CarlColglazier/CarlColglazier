I am a Doctoral Candidate in Technology and Social Behavior at Northwestern University where I am affiliated with the [Community Data Science Collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page).

My research focuses on decentralized social networks like the Fediverse and their role as sociotechnical systems. My research often uses computational social science to investigate how these systems handle “tricky problems” like content moderation and discovery. Some of my "academic" code lives on our lab [Gitea server](https://gitea.communitydata.science/CarlColglazier).
