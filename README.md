I am an incoming PhD student in Technology and Social Behavior at
Northwestern University, where I plan to study media systems and
their impact on public discourse.  I am also interested in the
relationship between online and offline communities and _how_ and
_why_ people use media to spread information over networks.

At North Carolina State University, I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in
Computer Science and a B.A. in Communication Media.  I am an alumni of
the Caldwell Fellows and Benjamin Franklin Scholars.
