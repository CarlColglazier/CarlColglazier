I am a PhD student in Technology and Social Behavior at Northwestern University where I am affiliated with the Community Data Science Collective.

My research focuses on decentralized social networks like the Fediverse and their role as sociotechnical systems. I like to use computational social science.

At North Carolina State University, I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Communication Media. Previously, I worked as intern in full stack software engineering at IBM and as an undergraduate researcher at the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame.
